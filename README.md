"Implement Caeser Cipher" This project is a part of my Cybersecurity Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

### DESCRIPTION
This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for text encryption and decryption. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### FEATURES
Encrypt any text input using a Caesar shift.
Decrypt the encrypted text using the same shift.
Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Keeps non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

### HOW TO RUN?
Run the Script: You can run the program using Python:
bash
python casercipher.py
2.Input
Enter your message.
Enter the shift value (e.g., 3).
3.Output
The script will display:
Original Message
Encrypted Message
Decrypted Message# PRODIGY_CS_01
